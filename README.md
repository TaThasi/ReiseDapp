### Mobile Development Coming Soon

We're committed to providing a seamless mobile experience for our users. As developers who are currently students, our primary goal is learning and research. Therefore, we aim to launch our mobile application as quickly as possible to expand our learning experience.
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
